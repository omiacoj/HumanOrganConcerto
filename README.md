# HumanOrganConcerto
Human Organ Concerto is an audiovisual installation that must be "performed" by the audience themselves. An organ is controlled wirelessly by the rhythm of the individual breathing of a group of people. They breathe through a device that translates their breath into 4 electrical pulses that are wirelessly connected to 4 different tones of the pipe organ.
